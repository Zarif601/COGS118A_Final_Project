# COGS118A_Final_Project

The study that I have conducted through the analysis of the three datasets, ADULT, COV_TYPE, and LETTER, demonstrate a comparison between the three analysis methods: K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest empirically. Since the field of Machine Learning is gaining importance in our world rapidly, more and more new techniques are evolving to perform data analysis. As such, the importance of empirical studies to analyze different methods of analysis are very important. In this study I chose to use ‘accuracy’ as the main error metric for the evaluation of the three different models. The study finds that for different datasets the performance of the algorithms varies. Even though Random Forest performs the best amongst the three different models on average, it doesn’t perform better than the other models on all three of the datasets.
